                            I'm currently researching large language models.
                            This includes token generation, model training,
                            architecture, and application. There is so much
                            potential with this emerging technology, and I'll
                            continue to build with it! Right now I'm focusing on
                            how to use LLMs for education. My current project is
                            LearningAbout, and you can read more about it under

                            My internship at TVA has been excellent so far. I've
                            worked in a small team of developers, and we've been
                            working on shipping an integration within the
                            company. I've been able to help with debugging
                            issues, writing unit tests, and getting a thorough
                            idea of how enterprise workflows, well... work.

                            For code specific development, I've increased my

                            cron jobs to database comparison and manipulation.
                            Also, my JavaScript understanding has been
                            particularly helpful in determining frontend/backend

                            Working at UTC was a great experience. Being a Web
                            Editor for the university allowed me to grow my
                            coding ability while managing the the content and
                            images used on the university's main website,

                            >. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for text styling
                            and functionality, and PHP and Node.js in web
                            projects.

                            LLMs know a lot. They know so much that they can
                            generate text about nearly any topic. And as they
                            continue to increase their knowledge and
                            capabilities, they only become better and better
                            teachers.

                            LearningAbout is a platform where people can enter
                            the subject they'd like to learn about, and a
                            roadmap of the subject is generated with topics and
                            subtopics. Additionally, a quiz is provided at the
                            end of each topic to test the user's knowledge.

                            Gupiteer is a project that centralizes LLMs. Instead
                            of relying on multiple websites to find the LLM
                            you'd like to use, Gupiteer provides a single
                            location to switch between LLMs. It follows much of
                            the same design as ChatGPT, including popular
                            features such as conversation history. Additionally,
                            the user only pays for usage, rather than a
                            subscription fee. By allowing the user to enter
                            their own API keys, the user only pays per request.
