                    <p>
                        Right now I'm working on a project called LIRO. It's a
                        video and photo hosting site with a blog section as
                        well. It's been a passion project since Vimeo was going
                        to begin charging $300/month to host videos. Right now
                        it is live on a Raspberry PI in my house. I've connected
                        it to a domain by getting a static IP address and
                        routing it through my router to the PI. It's currently
                        built using React, FastAPI, SQLite, and NGINX for
                        reverse proxy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, this is a new page of my website called
                        <a href="https://majorschwartz.com/now">/now</a>. It's
                        primary purpose is to display what I'm currently working
                        on, learning, or whatever else I want to share that is
                        currently happening. I'll try to update it every now and
                        then (likely when something interesting happens or when
                        I learn/begin something new).
