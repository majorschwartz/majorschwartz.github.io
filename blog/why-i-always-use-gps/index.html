						I will always use GPS. Also, I will always use a
						password manager. And a calendar. And a note-taking app.
					</p>
					<p>Why? Because our minds have finite space.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Data in the Mind</h2>
					<p>
						Our minds have intricate networks of neurons that allow
						us to remember things. But I can guarantee that you
						don't remember what you ate for dinner two weeks ago.
						And you shouldn't. If you do, you're doing something
						very wrong.
					</p>
					<p>
						When we create new memories and learn new subjects, we
						are tweaking our current network of neurons to "make
						space" for this new data. The pathways that get affected
						could be very valuable in representing knowledge about a
						specific topic.
					</p>
					<p>
						The knowledge that uses these pathways to represent
						itself isn't gone, but you make it harder to access
						because the amount of connections that can activate this
						area of the brain has decreased.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>We don't decrease loss</h2>
					<p>
						However, if you "write over" this area enough and the
						representations get skewed too much, you could end up
						losing the ability to remember the information
						altogether.
					</p>
					<p>
						Neural networks are beautiful because they fight this
						disappearance in the face of new data.
					</p>
					<p>
						Neural networks are designed such that they score their
						ability to remember <em>everything</em> they've been
						taught and then try to find the best way to add new data
						to the network without disrupting the current neural
						connections too much.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is in the form of a loss function which they are
						built to decrease. But we don't have loss functions
						controlling our memory.
						<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve"
							target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"
							>Ebbinghaus' forgetting curve</a
						>
						shows that the percentage of information we can remember
						drastically decreases over time. After about a week,
						you'll forget at least 80% of the information you were
						taught.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, if you want to remember something valuable, you need
						to review it. But also don't write over it with useless
						data, like directions to a restaurant. Leave that to
						machines.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Best Practices</h2>
					<p>
						Throw away learning anything that can be easily replaced
						by a tool or anything that isn't valuable enough to
						weaken the current pathways you've built up. Avoid
						repetitive tasks that will build up in your muscle
						memory without any benefit.
					</p>
					<p>
						Why even attempt to remember what you ate for dinner two
						weeks ago? The act of doing so will strengthen the
						pathways that represent the memory, and you will be
						better at retrieving a useless factoid. Congrats!
